            <h1>About Cork</h1>
            <p>Cork is a city in south-west Ireland, in the province of Munster, which had a population of 125,657 in
                2016. The city is on the River Lee which splits into two channels at the western end and divides the
                city centre into islands. They reconverge at the eastern end where the quays and docks along the river
                banks lead outwards towards Lough Mahon and Cork Harbour, one of the largest natural harbours in the
                world.</p>
            <p>Expanded by Viking invaders around 915, the city's charter was granted by Prince John, as Lord of
                Ireland, in 1185. Cork city was once fully walled, and the remnants of the old medieval town centre can
                be found around South and North Main streets.</p>
            <p>The third largest city on the island of Ireland, the city's cognomen of "the rebel city" originates in
                its support for the Yorkist cause in the Wars of the Roses. Corkonians often refer to the city as "the
                real capital", a reference to its opposition to the Anglo-Irish Treaty in the Irish Civil War.</p>

                    <h3>Early settlement</h3>
                    <img src="images/his1.png" alt="">
                    <p>Cork was originally a monastic settlement, reputedly founded by Saint Finbarr in the 6th century.
                        Cork achieved an urban character at some point between 915 and 922 when Norseman (Viking)
                        settlers founded a trading port. It has been proposed that, like Dublin, Cork was an important
                        trading centre in the global Scandinavian trade network. The ecclesiastical settlement continued
                        alongside the Viking longphort, with the two developing a type of symbiotic relationship; the
                        Norsemen providing otherwise unobtainable trade goods for the monastery, and perhaps also
                        military aid.</p>

                    <h3>The city</h3>
                    <img src="images/his2.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>The city's charter was granted by Prince John, as Lord of Ireland, in 1185. The city was once
                        fully walled, and some wall sections and gates remain today. For much of the Middle Ages, Cork
                        city was an outpost of Old English culture in the midst of a predominantly hostile Gaelic
                        countryside and cut off from the English government in the Pale around Dublin. Neighbouring
                        Gaelic and Hiberno-Norman lords extorted "Black Rent" from the citizens to keep them from
                        attacking the city. The present extent of the city has exceeded the medieval boundaries of the
                        Barony of Cork City; it now takes in much of the neighbouring Barony of Cork. Together, these
                        baronies are located between the Barony of Barrymore to the east, Muskerry East to the west and
                        Kerrycurrihy to the south.</p>
                    <p>The city's municipal government was dominated by about 12–15 merchant families, whose wealth came
                        from overseas trade with continental Europe – in particular the export of wool and hides and the
                        import of salt, iron and wine. The medieval population of Cork was about 2,100 people. It
                        suffered a severe blow in 1349 when almost half the townspeople died of plague when the Black
                        Death arrived in the town. In 1491, Cork played a part in the English Wars of the Roses when
                        Perkin Warbeck a pretender to the English throne, landed in the city and tried to recruit
                        support for a plot to overthrow Henry VII of England. The then mayor of Cork and several
                        important citizens went with Warbeck to England but when the rebellion collapsed they were all
                        captured and executed. The title of Mayor of Cork was established by royal charter in 1318, and
                        the title was changed to Lord Mayor in 1900 following the knighthood of the incumbent Mayor by
                        Queen Victoria on her Royal visit to the city.</p>

                    <img src="images/his3.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Since the nineteenth century, Cork had been a strongly Irish nationalist city, with widespread
                        support for Irish Home Rule and the Irish Parliamentary Party, but from 1910 stood firmly behind
                        William O'Brien's dissident All-for-Ireland Party. O'Brien published a third local newspaper,
                        the Cork Free Press.</p>
                    </p>In the War of Independence, the centre of Cork was burnt down by the British Black and Tans,
                    in an event known as the "Burning of Cork" and saw fierce fighting between Irish guerrillas and
                    UK forces. During the Irish Civil War, Cork was for a time held by anti-Treaty forces, until it was
                    retaken by the pro-Treaty National Army in an attack from the sea.</p>
